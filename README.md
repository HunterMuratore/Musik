# Project 2

## Description

The Musik app is a project to connect users who will be able to share songs and posts with each other. We want to create a community of music lovers who have similar interests.
As fellow music lovers we want to have a place where it is just about music. This project was built to have like minded individuals to come together and make a community.
Musik brings those people to meet and post about music we are listening to. We learned how to make a social media hub for only music lovers.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
