## Description

The Musik app is a project to connect users who will be able to share songs and posts with each other. We want to create a community of music lovers who have similar interests.
As fellow music lovers we want to have create a place just for music. This project was built to have like minded individuals to come together and create a community.
Musik brings users to meet and post about music others are listening to. We learned how to make a social media hub for only music lovers.
